<h1>üñºÔ∏èü§ñ Image_Converting_AI-Agent</h1> 

Converts selected Images into user-chosen formats.

This beginner project was started late-May to help me improve my programming and technical skills.

#### In this project I utilized libraries such as:
 - PIL (Python Imaging Library)
 - OS (Operating System)
 - tkinter (for Application Window)

<hr>

I was planning on keeping the project and it's development to myself until I realized I could simultanously use and learn the benefits of GitHub and developer collaboration!!

Nonetheless, I encourage all who see this make a pull request if there are identified areas of improvement or overlooked scenarios. I appreciate all help and contributions!
