 - OS (Operating System)
 - tkinter (for Application Window)

#### Other tools used:
 - npm
 - node.js
 - Electron


To run program:
1. Clone Repository
2. Navigate & Open Repository in local IDE
3. type ```npm run start``` in Terminal
4. Hit Enter and watch it work üòÅ

I was planning on keeping the project and it's development to myself until I realized I could simultanously use and learn the benefits of GitHub and developer collaboration!!

Nonetheless, I encourage all who see this make a pull request if there are identified areas of improvement or overlooked scenarios. I appreciate all help and contributions!
